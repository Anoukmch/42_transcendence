- [ ] Implement functions (e.g. add_member_to_channel?, remove_member_from_channel?, etc.)
  This can then be used in multiple places (e.g. views_chat.py, views_personal.py, etc.)
  This also allows for easier implementation of websocket notifications since there is only one function that performs one action

- [ ] Maybe find way or alternative to datetime which can be better serialized to JSON or something else
